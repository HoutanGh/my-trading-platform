- [ ] fix the cli flow (a lot of errors)
    - [ ] note down the flow
    - [ ] note down where there isn't error handnling
- [ ] note down the flow for the csv ingestion

- [ ] service has things that should be in orders, pretty sure service is not meant to have any ib_insync code
- [ ] test if it subscribes to 1min data, just test everything in general


- [ ] could you not generalise breakout_watcher.py, maybe the pure logic has inputs that help the strings make sense in the function
- [ ] cli needs option to inform you if it is prepost, market or closed market
